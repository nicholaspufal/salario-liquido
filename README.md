# salario-liquido

Net salary calculator for brazilian citizens. The idea is that this will be made available as a service soon and an iOS app will communicate with it.

Multiple goals here:

* Practice BDD skills by trying to document the business domain using a feature file - written in pt-br. The idea here is to try to come up with concrete examples, easy to understand, as some folks from BR also have some hard time to understand how this calculation happens.
* Practice Node.js/Javascript
* Learn Swift - and develop my first iOS app :)
* Create a simple yet flexible architecture, so that if I need to change any calculations I won't need to make updates to the app - only to this service
